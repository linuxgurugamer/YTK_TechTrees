1.0 Description:
----------------
This mod's intention is to make it easier to customize tech trees for Kerbal.  It allows part unlocks to be listed in the TechTree ConfigNode rather than having to edit every Part ConfigNode.  It also adds a tree selection window to let the player select a tree for each new game.


=================
2.0 Installation:
-----------------
Copy the contents of GameData into the Kerbal GameData folder.  If you have Kerbal on Steam this will be:
<steam dir>\steamapps\common\Kerbal Space Program\GameData\
